                    The Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park is a protected area of India consisting of 21 small islands (islets) and adjacent coral reefs in the Gulf of Mannar in the Indian Ocean. It lies 1 to 10 km away from the east coast of Tamil Nadu, India for 160 km between Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) and Dhanushkodi. It is the core area of the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve which includes a 10 km buffer zone around the park, including the populated coastal area.[1] The park has a high diversity of plants and animals in its marine, intertidal and near shore habitats. Public access inside the park is limited to glass-bottom boat rides.[2] It was established as a National Park in 1986.[3]
                    <br><br>The park includes marine components such as coral reefs, seaweed communities, sea grasses, and mangroves.[8]

                    Mangroves dominate the intertidal zones of the park islands. They consist of species of the genera Rhizophora, Avicennia, Bruguiera, Ceriops and Lumnitzera.[9] The introduced tree genus Prosopis is dominant on land in all the islands. The flowering herb Pemphis acidula (family Lythraceae) is the only endemic plant species.[10] 12 species of sea grass and 147 species of seaweeds were recorded. This vegetation provides important feeding grounds for vulnerable marine mammals such as the dugong,[6] endangered green turtles and olive ridley turtles.[11]
                    <br><br>
                    the park there are about 125 villages which support about 100,000 people who are mainly Marakeyars, a local community principally engaged in fishing.[4][9]

                    The 560 km2 (220 sq mi) park is part of the 140 km long and 25 km wide Mannar barrier reef. It lies between 8° 47' to 9° 15' N latitude and 78° 12' to 79° 14' E longitude. The 21 islands vary from 0.25 ha (.6 acre) to 130 ha. (321.2 acres). The total area of the islands is 6.23 km2 (2.41 sq mi).
