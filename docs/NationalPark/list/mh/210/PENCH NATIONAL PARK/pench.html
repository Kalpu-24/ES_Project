                    This includes several rare and endangered plants as well as plants of ethno-botanical importance.</p>

                        The reserve has a high tiger density and is an important tiger source area of the Central India
                        Landscape. As per the 2010 country level assessment using the refined methodology, the tiger
                        estimate for the Pench landscape is 65 (ranging from 53 to 78) with an increasing trend. The forest
                        divisions surrounding the reserve like South Seoni, East Chhindwara and South Chhindwara
                        divisions also support resident tigers. These areas have been incorporated in the buffer of the tiger
                        reserve</p>
