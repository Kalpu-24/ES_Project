                    <span>General Information</span>
                </h1>
                <p>Dachigam National Park is a national park located, 22 kilometres (14 mi) from Srinagar city in
                    Srinagar district of Jammu and Kashmir, India on the east side of Dal Lake. It covers an area of
                    161|62.16(updated recently) by hgtian student SIJ. The name of the park literally stands for "ten
                    villages" which is in the memory of the ten villages that were relocated for its formation.
                    <br> These ten villages were living in this region before the World War I in the beginning of 20th
                    century. The main gate entrance is very close to the New Theed general bus stand on the either side
                    of Darul Uloom Kousaria.

                    The park has been a protected area since 1910, first under the care of the Maharaja of Jammu and
                    Kashmir and later under the observation of the concerned government authorities. It was initially
                    created to ensure a supply of clean drinking water for Srinagar. It was upgraded and declared a
                    National Park in 1981
                </p>

                </h1>
                <p>Dachigam National park is located in the Zabarwan Range of the western Himalayas. The variation in
                    altitude is vast, ranging from 5500 ft to 14000 ft above mean sea level. Due to this vast variation,
                    the park is demarcated into an uneven region. The terrain ranges from gently sloping grasslands to
                    sharp rocky outcrops and cliffs.</p>

                    Dachigam was initially established to ensure the supply of clean drinking water to Srinagar city. A
                    protected area since 1910, it was declared as a national park in 1981. The park is best known as the
                    home of the hangul, or Kashmir stag. Dachigam is open throughout the year, but the best time to
                    visit is between April and August. The closest airport is at Srinagar. Habitat to Kashmir Stag :
                    Only area where Kashmir stag is found.

                    <br>
                    The mountain sides below the tree line are wooded. Most of this coniferous forest consists of broad
                    leaf species. Interspersed between these are alpine pastures, meadows, waterfalls and scrub
                    vegetation with deep gullies, locally known as Nars, running down the mountain face. Most of the
                    grasslands and meadows, except in the harsh winters, are covered with coloured flowers. Located high
                    among its interiors is the Marsar lake from which flows the Dagwan river. This river flows all the
                    way down to, and past, the lower region where it runs along the only proper road in the park and is
                    also known for its fish population, the trout.

                    The park is situated at altitudes ranging from 5500 ft to 14,000 ft. Due to the variation in
                    altitudes the park is demarcated into upper and lower regions. The park’s terrain ranges from gently
                    sloping grasslands to cliffs and sharp rocky outcrops.

                    The park boasts of over 500 species of herbs, 50 species of trees and about 20 species of shrubs.
                    Besides Hangul, Dachigam is also famous for its populations of musk deer, leopard, Himalayan Grey
                    Langur, leopard cat, Himalayan Black Bear, yellow-throated marten among others. It’s a paradise for
                    bird watchers. Himalayan monal, golden oriole, pygmy owlet, koklass pheasant, Kashmir flycatcher,
                    Tytler’s leaf warbler, streaked laughingthrush, Himalayan rubythroat and many other species can be
                    found at Dachigam.

                    Dachigam national park is also known for its scenic locales. Flowers and greenery carpet grasslands
                    and meadows except during winter, when the entire forest remains blanketed under snow. The sight of
                    blue poppy blooms covering the grassland is a sight to behold. Wildlife enthusiasts believe that one
                    visit to Dachigam is not enough to enjoy the natural beauty of the forest since the park changes its
                    appearance with the onset of each season. The autumn rutting of Hangul should not be missed. Fierce
                    male competition for mating characterizes the rutting season and the forest echoes with the mating
                    calls of the deer. ALSO SEE 7 Nights and 8 days Jammu and Kashmir itinerary for a vacation in

                    After Jammu and Kashmir acceded to India, Dachigam was managed by the State Forest Department. Jammu
                    and Kashmir government notified the area as a sanctuary in 1951 and as a national park in 1981. The
                    best way to explore the park is to go for a trek along with a local guide. To enter the park, a
                    special permit from the chief wildlife warden is needed.
                    BEST PLACES TO STAY NEAR DACHIGAM NATIONAL PARK

                    Accommodation options are limited in Dachigam. The Forest Department mai ntains two rest houses in

                    options.
