                <h1><span>History</span></h1>
                <p>Ranthambore National Park was established initially as Sawai Madhopur Game Sanctuary in 1955 by the Government of India. In 1973, it was declared as one of the Project Tiger reserves in India. It was on 1st November, 1980 that Ranthambore was declared a national park, while the forests located beside it were named Sawai Man Singh Sanctuary & Keladevi Sanctuary.</p>
                <h1><span>Geography</span></h1>
                <p>Ranthambore national park is one of the most celebrated tiger reserves of India with its own specific flora and fauna which attracts wildlife tourists from all over the world. When it comes to the flora and fauna of a reserve forest, it's good to start with the fauna first as this is what makes people to visit here often. <br><br>

                Obviously, the majestic Tiger is the prime and most coveted mammal of this reserve park, which is also the apex predator of this region and comes first in the food chain of the Ranthambore forest. Though the tiger is known to be a nocturnal and solitary predator and a master of stealth hunting skills, but tigers of the Ranthambore park are diurnal in nature due to which they are easily visible in daytime making it one of the most visited reserve forests by tiger lovers. <br><br>
                
                Apart from the tiger, other big cats of the Ranthambore reserve park are Leopard, Leopard cat, Desert cat, Caracal, Fishing cat and Jungle cat. However, the park is the home to these so many big cats, but the tigers are the lords of this land and rule the region with pride.

                Therefore, other than the majestic tiger due to which this region is mostly toured for, watching the beauty and vigor of other animals also are equally enjoyable.
