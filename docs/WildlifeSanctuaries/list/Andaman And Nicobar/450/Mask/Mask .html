                <h1><span>History</span></h1>
                <p>North Bay Island, also known as Coral Island or Mask Island, has a rich history that dates back to the British colonial era in India. The island was discovered by the British in the late 18th century and was initially used as a military outpost due to its strategic location in the Bay of Bengal.<br><br>

                During World War II, the island was occupied by the Japanese, who built several bunkers and gun emplacements on the island as part of their defensive strategy. The island was later retaken by the British in 1945, and many of the bunkers and gun emplacements can still be seen on the island today.<br><br>

                After India gained independence from British colonial rule in 1947, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands became a part of the Indian Union. North Bay Island was subsequently developed as a tourist destination due to its natural beauty and unique marine life. Today, the island attracts thousands of visitors every year who come to explore its coral reefs and enjoy various water activities.<br><br>

                In recent years, efforts have been made to promote eco-tourism on the island while also preserving the marine ecosystem. The local authorities have implemented various measures to ensure that the coral reefs and marine life are protected from damage caused by human activities. Visitors are advised to follow the rules and regulations of the island and to be responsible tourists to help preserve the island's natural beauty and ecosystem for future generations.</p>
