                <h1><span>History</span></h1>
                <p> Prior to the 20th century, the area that is now Itanagar was primarily inhabited by various
                    indigenous tribes who had their own distinct cultures and traditions.
                    In the early 20th century, the British established administrative control over the area, and it
                    became part of the North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA), which was a region that comprised of several
                    districts in the northeastern part of India.
                    In 1954, the capital of NEFA was shifted from Shillong to Itanagar, which was then a small village.
                    The construction of the new capital began in the 1960s, and the town gradually grew into a city with
                    modern infrastructure and amenities.
                    In 1972, NEFA was renamed Arunachal Pradesh, and Itanagar became its permanent capital. The city has
                    since then continued to grow and develop, and today it is a vibrant and bustling metropolis that
                    serves as the administrative, cultural, and economic center of the state.
