                <p> Idukki is one of the 14 districts of Kerala state, India, created on 26 January 1972. This beautiful High range district of Kerala is geographically known for its Mountainous Hills and Dense Forests. For the people of Kerala, Idukki is always associated with Power Generation.

                    <br><br> Idukki which lies in the Western Ghats of Kerala is the second largest district in area but has the lowest population density. Idukki has a vast forest reserve area; more than a half of the district is covered by forests. The urban areas are densely populated whereas villages are sparsely populated. Idukki is also known as the spice garden of Kerala.
                    
                </p>
                <h1><span>History</span></h1>
                <p>Idukki district, the second largest district in Kerala, came into existence on January 26, 1972, by carving out Devikulam, Udumbanchola and Peerumedu taluks from erstwhile Kottayam district and Thodupuzha taluk (excluding Kalloorkad Village and portion of Manjalloor Village included in Kalloorkad and Manjalloor Panchayats) of erstwhile Ernakulam district.</p>
                 At the time of formation the district headquarters was at Kottayam. In 1976, it was shifted to Painavu in Thodupuzha taluk.
                <br><br>Idukki district lies in the Western Ghats of Kerala and has an area of 436345 sq.km. Idukki district lies in 9o 15' and 10o 2' latitude and between 76o 37' and 77o 25' longitude.
                <h1><span>Geography</span></h1>
                <p>'Idukki', the name of the district is supposed to be derived from the Malayalam word 'Idukku' which means a narrow ravine. Its main magnetism lies in its Mountains, Valleys, dams, wildlife sanctuaries, Hill Stations and beautiful lakes.
                <br><br>
                    The population of this district mainly consists of tribal people. Munnar hill station is one of the best-attracted places in Idduki. There are nearly 14 peaks and among them Anamudi peak is the highest which towers over 2695 metres. Among the exotic flora found in the forests and grasslands in this region is the Neelakurinji, this flower that enwraps the hills in blue every twelve years, will bloom next in 2006 AD.
                <br><br>
