                <h1><span>General Information</span></h1>
                <p>
                    The Marine Park and Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Kutch are the first Marine National Park in India.
                     In the years 1980 and 1982, the Gulf of Kutch was declared as India’s first Marine Wildlife Sanctuary and
                      Marine National Park, respectively. There are 42 islands in this remote park, 33 of which are bordered by
                      coral reefs, stretching a total of 170 kilometres down the coast. The sanctuary is located in the intertidal zone,
                      where the region submerged in water at high tide may be viewed during low tide. More than a half-dozen coral
                       species can be found in the reefs around some of the region’s most beautiful islands. There are over 80 species 
                       of birds observed here.
                </p>
                <h1><span>Fauna</span></h1>
                <p>

                    A sea slug on the sea floor rock. As the sea recedes, the sea creatures are exposed to the harsh sunlight before they retreat to deeper waters or take cover under rocks.

                    The western reef heron (dark morphed) on the prowl.
                    The birds visit the Narara coasts during low tide to pick on the fishes and crustaceans hiding beneath the rocks and reefs.
                    Jellyfish, Portuguese man of war and sea anemones are other coelenterates found here. Arthropods include 27 species of prawns, 
                    30 species of crabs, lobsters, shrimps and other crustaceans. Molluscs like pearl oysters and sea slugs are present.
                    Octopus which change colour are also found. Echinoderms like starfish, sea cucumbers and sea urchins are present.
                    The fishes found are puffer fishes, sea horse, sting ray, mudskippers and whale sharks which are an endangered species. <br><br>
                    Endangered sea turtles such as green sea turtles, olive ridleys and leatherbacks are seen here. 
                    There are three species of sea snakes. There are dugongs and smaller cetaceans like finless porpoises, common dolphins,
                    bottlenose dolphins and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Larger whales such as blue whales,sei whales are seen.
                    Humpback whales, and sperm whales may have been almost wiped out due to illegal whaling by the Soviet Union and Japan. Whale sharks can be found in deeper areas. A surprisingly large scale greater flamingo colony, reaching up to 20,000 nests is known to occur along the gulf and many other birds species found here like crab plovers, sandpipers, western reef egret, great egret, ruff, eurasian oystercatcher, greenshanks, redshanks, gulls, skimmers, ducks, pelicans, storks, Godwits, terns.
                    There are 42 islands in the Arabian Sea with coral reefs and the park is situated in one of those.
                    
                </p>
                <h1><span>History</span></h1>
                <p>The Marine National Park was the first marine conservatory established in India in 1982. Gujarat has the longest coastline in Indian which consists of two gulfs, and they are the Gulf of Kutch and the Gulf of Khambat. The Marine National Park and the Marine Sanctuary were constructed with the aim of protecting two major ecosystems namely, mangroves and corals. They are located in fragmented areas consisting of the districts of Jamnagar, Dwarka, and Morbi. The park was established in the intertidal region along the coast and consists of 42 islands some being Karubhar, Pirotan, and Narara which has an exposed reef.</p>
                <h1><span>Geography</span></h1>
                <p>
                    The Jamnagar district of Gujarat’s state is home to the Marine National Park Gulf of Kutch. The Saurashtra peninsula and the Great and Little Ranns of Kutch are separated by the Gulf of Kutch, an arm of the Arabian Sea off India’s west coast. Seaward is 58 kilometres broad, whereas on the eastern side, it is 170 kilometres wide. It is one of the Marine-protected areas in India.The Marine Sanctuary when established extended over an area of 270 sq. km., from Okha to Jodhya. The core area of 110 sq. km. was subsequently notified as the Marine Park, comprising areas of 7,000 ha off Okha in the west and 4,000 ha off Jamnagar to the east.
