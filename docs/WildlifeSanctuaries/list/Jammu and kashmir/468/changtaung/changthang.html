                </p>
                <h1><span>History</span></h1>
                <p>There was a time when this particular region was ruled by the followers of Zhangzhung culture. It was an ancient culture which even, interestingly, pre-dates Tibetan Buddhism.Being associated with the Bon religion, this culture has heavily influenced the philosophies and practices which are related to Tibetan Buddhism. The people from this timeline are frequently mentioned in the ancient Tibetan texts as the original rulers of central and western Tibet. </p>
                <h1><span>Geography</span></h1>
                <p>Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary is situated in northern India in the union territory of Ladakh. The sanctuary lies on the Ladakhi Changthang Plateau where the lowest elevation is about 4,260 m (14,000 ft).
                    <br><br>
                    The park spans 1,600 sq km (618 sq mi) of land across Ladakh. It is one of the largest wildlife reserves in the world, alongside Northeast Greenland National Park in Greenland. Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary is home to 11 lakes and 10 marshes. The Indus River runs throughout the protected region, separating the land into two distinct sections.
                    Deep gorgers and vast plateaus are found throughout the sanctuary, amidst the rugged peaks of the Himalaya that tower above. The vast plateaus allow for the wildlife of the region to thrive in this often inhospitable landscape.

Additionally, Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary is surrounded by other popular outdoor recreation areas. In particular, the Karakoram (Nubra Shyok) Wildlife Sanctuary lies to the north, Hemis National Park, Kishtwar National Park, and Thajwas- Baltal Wildlife Sanctuary to the west, and the Sech Tuan Nala Wildlife Sanctuary to the southwest.



                    <br><br>
                    The mountains in the Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary are part of the Himalaya proper, similar to other parks in the region. The Himalaya started to form during the Late Cretaceous when the Eurasian plate and the Indian plate collided. Indeed, the Himalaya, including the peaks in the sanctuary, are a relatively young mountain range, despite their rich geologic history.
                    This collision of these plates gave rise to many of the tallest peaks in the world, whose snow-capped peaks can be seen from the wildlife sanctuary. Common rocks found in the sanctuary include dolomite, limestone, phyllite, quartzite, and slate.
                    <br><br>
                    Though the mountains in the range appear to be stagnant, the Indian plate is still moving northward into the Tibetan Plateau at a rate of about 67 mm (2.6 in) per year. As a result, the Himalaya continue to rise around 5 mm (0.2 in) each year.</p>
                    <h1><span>Human History</span></h1>
                    <p>Humans have inhabited the region that surrounds the Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary for thousands of years. Nearby rock carvings dating back at least 12,000 years. During the first century, the Ladakh region was part of the Kushan Empire.
                        <br><br> The Ladakh region was under rule from various empires and countries over the following centuries. Nearly 400 years ago, the monastery located on the northeastern boundary of the park was established. This Buddhist monastery is still in use today and parts of it can be visited by tourists.<br><br>
                        During the partition of India in 1947, the region was signed over to India. Within the sanctuary boundaries lies the village of Karzok. Located at an elevation of 4,595 m (15,075 ft) it is one of the highest villages in the world. Including the Drukpa Buddhist Korzok Monastery, there are around 1,300 people who inhabit the village.<br><br>
                        The Changthang Wildlife Sanctuary was eventually established in 1987 in order to protect the unique landscape, flora, and fauna. The sanctuary acts as an important landscape for the Tibetan wildass and the endangered bar-headed geese.

Tourists and visitors couldn’t visit the sanctuary until 1994, since it marks the border leading into China. Today tourists can visit the regions surrounding Pangong Tso and Tso Morari lakes.</p>
