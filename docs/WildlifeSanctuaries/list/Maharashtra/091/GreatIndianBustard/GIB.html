                <h1><span>General Information</span></h1>
                <p>Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary (established in 1979, also known as the Jawaharlal Nehru Bustard Sanctuary of Maharashtra) is a wildlife sanctuary for the great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) at Solapur, Maharashtra, India. The land is drought-prone and semi-arid.It is in the Deccan thorn scrub forests ecoregion. <br><br> Maharashtra is one of the six states of India where great Indian bustards (Ardeotis nigriceps) are still seen. The great Indian bustard at Nannaj and Karmala was first identified By Mr B.S.Kulkarni in 1972 and with his constant efforts to save the bird had resulted in Dr. Salim Ali visiting Nannaj and starting a research project. Mr Kulkarni wrote extensively in local newspapers and made people aware of its existence and he is still active in trying to protect the bird and its habitat at Nannaj, near Solapur. In former days the bustard was a common bird in the dry districts of Maharashtra.

                <h1><span>Wild Life</span></h1>
                <p>Due to the rapid concretisation of the lands and urbanisation, the shelter places of the animals, birds etc. are getting diminished and these creatures are finding it very difficult to survive and some species are becoming extinct.  Looking at this grave situation, the local Governments have swung into action and taken steps to declare some of the Wldlife and Bird Sanctuaries all over the country to preserve the rare species of Animals and Birds. The Great Indian Bustard (Maldhok) is one of such rarest birds of Indian Sub continent. The Bird is found only in some parts of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh States. The respective State Governments have declared the sancturies for the Great Indian Bustard. <br><br> The Government of Maharashtra declared Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary in 1979 with the sole objective of conserving the rarest species of Great Indian Bustard which are endangered with extinction. The sanctuary consists of the area of North Solapur, Madha, Mohol and Karmala Talukas of Solapur District and Karjat, Shrigonda, Newasa Talukas of Ahmednagar District covering a total area of 8496.44 sq.kms.This bird has been included in the Schedule-1 of Wildlife Act 1972 and accordingly due protection has been given to this bird. The headquarters of the sanctuary are Nannaj of Solapur District and Rehekuri of Ahmednagar District.</p>
