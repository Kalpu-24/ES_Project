                <h1><span>General Information</span></h1>
                <p>Ghodazari Wildlife Sanctuary is a wildlife reserve established in 2018 in Nagbhir in the Chandrapur district of the Vidarbha region in Maharashtra, India.[1] It includes 159 km2 (61 sq mi) of southern tropical dry forest and a lake. The forest is considered a key region on the connecting corridor for the tiger migration between the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Project and Umred Karhandala Wildlife Sanctuary. It is named after a village of the same name that is almost in the middle of the forest, about 2 km from the dam and the resort. In Marathi, ghoda means horse and zari means a place with a water spring.
                    <br><br>Tigers are the main attraction and the reason for the creation of the sanctuary. Census records show there are at least 12 tigers in the region, but because the sanctuary is on the tiger migration pathway, tigers from the Tadoba and Umred Karhandala sanctuaries have been seen and recorded in tiger research in this region
                    <br><br>
                    The sanctuary is also home to other wild mammals such as Indian leopards, sloth bears, gaur, dhole, nilgai, small Indian civet, jungle cats, sambar, barking deer, chital, and wild boar.
