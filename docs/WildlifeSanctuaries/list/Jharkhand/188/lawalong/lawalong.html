                <h1><span>History</span></h1>
                <p>Lawalong Wildlife Sanctuary was earlier under the control of the Raja of Ramgarh and other landlords in the area. The government took charge in 1924 and in 1947 it became a private protected forest. The ownership vested with the Government of Bihar in 1953. In earlier days, the presence of wildlife in high numbers in these forests attracted hunters from all over the country. One of the owners of this area, the Tikait of Kunda Estate used to organise “shikar” from time to time, in a big way. Subsequently, hunting was completely banned under the Wildlife Protection Act 1972. There are 64 villages in the sanctuary area and the people of these villages have certain rights and privileges, as for example grazing cattle and collecting firewood.</p>
